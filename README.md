CSCI 340 (Operating Systems) programming assignments

See readme files in individual project folders for more details! 

project1 is in Python

project2 is in Scala (The bulk of project1 was ported to Scala) -- Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU scheduling; FSCAN disk scheduling...some of it was correct...the large chunk of it was wrong and it kinda crashes...grade comments included for anyone who uses it. Crash was fixed in project3 as project3 is an extension of the previous 2 projects. 

project3 - contiguous memory management added.
